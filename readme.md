# **INeuron Homepage | Hackathon**

Hello, I'm **Vikash Yadav** 

This project is a part of the **Hackathon for Javascript live batch** which is organized online on [Findcoder.io](https://www.findcoder.io/).


### **Goal of project**

In this hackathon, we have to redesign [INeuron](https://ineuron.ai/) website's homepage. So I have tried to do that only with HTMl and CSS.


**Note :** This project is not optimized for mobile yet.
